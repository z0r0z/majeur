1. Always run `biome lint dapp` after completed code changes to Majeur.html or DAICO.html; do not run lint commands in any other way!

2. The frontend server runs in a tmux session named "dapp". When you need to check logs or debug issues, tail the logs from this tmux session rather than restarting the server.
